As basketball players get better and better at their craft in the modern age, players are doing everything 
they can to get an advantage over another. With practice, coaches, and trainers players can work hard at 
mastering their craft but what about the more physical aspects of their game? How does a players' height
and weight impact the performance ability of an NBA Player? Does being taller translate to scoring more
points per game? Does weight increase the amount of rebounds you will grab? Answers to such questions
will offer valuable insight to coaches, scouts, and analysts in making data-driven decisions for their teams.
This paper aims to determine whether, and to what extent, a player's height and weight influence their 
effectiveness in scoring, rebounding, assisting and other metrics through the use of linear regression and
machine learning techniques.
